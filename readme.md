## Assignment Description

In this assignment, I am tasked with designing and implementing a micro-frontend architecture for an e-commerce platform. The platform is expected to have several distinct features, each managed as a separate micro-frontend. These features include:

1. **Product Listings Micro-Frontend**: Responsible for displaying a list of products. Users should be able to filter and sort products. Additionally, it should include an "Add to Cart" button for each product.

2. **User Authentication Micro-Frontend**: This micro-frontend handles user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and log out. JWT-based authentication should be implemented.

3. **Shopping Cart Micro-Frontend**: This micro-frontend manages the shopping cart. It should enable users to view, update, and clear items in their cart. The total price of items in the cart should be displayed.

4. **Order History Micro-Frontend**: Designed to display the user's order history. It should show information such as the order date, products purchased, and total price. Users should have the ability to view their past orders.

Key requirements for this assignment include the use of Redux for managing global state, a seamless navigation system, responsiveness across various screen sizes and devices, error handling with clear error messages, and comprehensive testing and documentation.

## Tech Stack

For this assignment, I've used modern web development technologies and best practices. Here's the tech stack:

- **Documentation**: Provide clear instructions on how to run and deploy each micro-frontend
